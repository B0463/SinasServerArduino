Protocol:
byte 1: 0 - 255, is the size of the package.
byte 2 - 257, is the package.

for example the package "AF 04 05 1A" is transmited with:

size of package
vv
04 AF 0A 05 1A
   ^^^^^^^^^^^
   package.

program IO:

ex: 
<< 0x45 \\ data sended
>> 0x01 \\ first byte (package size)
>> 0x45 \\ segoncd byte (package content)

Commands:
0x00 to 0x7F is get commands.
0x80 to 0xFF it set commands.

the MSB bit 1 define set command, the MSB bit 0 define get command.

get commands:

the get commands can return values that overflows a byte, then some commands can be "low and high byte" or "byte 1, 2, 3 and 4".

00 - get fan RPM.
First Byte: lowByte (0(lsb)-7)
Second Byte: highByte (8-15(msb))

set commands:

if MSB bit is 1, it means that is a set command, and the others 7 bits is a data to set.

you can set the fan PWM from 0 (min) to 127 (max)
